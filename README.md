# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System

##  Overview
Food wastage is a major social and environmental issue. A large amount of edible food is wasted every day by restaurants, events, and households, while many people struggle with food insecurity.

The Local Food Wastage Management System is a data analytics project designed to analyze food wastage patterns and provide insights that help reduce waste and improve food redistribution at a local level. This project was developed during my internship at Labmentrix.

##  Objectives
- Analyze local food wastage data
- Identify key sources of food waste
- Study surplus and demand trends
- Generate insights to reduce food wastage
- Promote sustainable food management
